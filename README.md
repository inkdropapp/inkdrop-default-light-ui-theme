# Default Light UI Theme for Inkdrop

Inkdrop's UI elements are styled based on [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/).
It's mostly common in customizing the theme with it, so [their documentation](http://learnsemantic.com/) is very helpful to get started.

Read [the documentation](https://developers.inkdrop.app/guides/create-a-theme) for detailed instructions.
